**Bold text**
*Italic text*
##It marks the second attempt at exploring Github
~~Striketrought text~~
**Bold text _with italic_ inside**
***All Bold All italic***
###The main purpose will be to try all markdown elements 
Text<sub>appearing as subscript</sub>
text<sup>appearing as superscript</sup>
Those last two arent working like the others....

Not quoted text
`git status` lists all new or modified files that have not been commited
basic git commands include:
git status 
git add
git commit
```
triple backticks format code in a distinct block
it looks interesting 
and my key for the backtick is missing
``` 
All this information was pulled from [here] (https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax)
